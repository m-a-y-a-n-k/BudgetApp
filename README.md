# BudgetApp (Vite)

This project was migrated from a static HTML/CSS/JS setup to a **Vite** vanilla project.

## Local dev

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build + preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- Static assets live in `public/` and are served at the site root.
- App entrypoint is `src/main.js` (which imports `src/app.js`).
